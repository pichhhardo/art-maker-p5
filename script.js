// This line (which starts with two forward slashes) is what we call a comment!
// Comments are ignored by the computer, and they're very handy for writing notes to yourself!

// You can use comments for short explanations of what your code does,
//    or to leave yourself reminders ("TODO: fix this bug on line 27!"),
//    or to include ASCII art and silly emojis.   ⊂(◉‿◉)つ     ヽ༼ ಠ益ಠ ༽ﾉ     ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

// You can also "comment out" lines of code to keep old versions of code handy as a reference,
//     without having the computer actual run the code. This is a really useful trick! :)
// For example, here's some broken code saved inside some comments:
//     console.log(blablah);
//     console.log(stuff in here);

// **Important tip:**
// You can "comment out" a bunch of code all at once by selecting multiple lines of code,
//    and then pressing Ctrl + / on Windows or Cmd + / on Mac.
//    You can repeat the process to "uncomment" lines of code too.

console.log("This line of code displays a message (this message!!) in the browser console. Hello, world!");
