// Let's draw some stuff by writing some code together!


// The code inside the setup function will run ONLY ONCE when you open the web page
function setup() {
  
  // The createCanvas function creates a <canvas> element on the page after it loads, which lets us draw stuff!
  createCanvas(500, 500);
  


  
}


// The code inside the draw function will run OVER AND OVER again (so later, we can animate!)
function draw() {
  
  rect(100, 30, 50, 50);
  text("Liz", 100, 30);
  
}
